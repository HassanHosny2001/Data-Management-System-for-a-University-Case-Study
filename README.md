# University Data Management System

## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive data management system for a university using SQL, PLSQL, Advanced PLSQL, Red Hat, Bash scripting, Java SE, and OOP principles. The project encompasses various aspects, including database design, SQL and PLSQL implementation, automation scripts, Java application development, and integration.

## Milestones

### 1. Database Design:
- Define a relational database schema including students, courses, departments, and grades.
- Normalize the schema to ensure data integrity.
- Document the database design.

### 2. SQL Implementation:
- Create SQL scripts to build the database schema.
- Populate the database with sample data.
- Test and validate the correctness of the database.

### 3. PLSQL Implementation:
- Write PLSQL scripts for:
  - Updating some information.
  - Calculating GPA.
- Test the PLSQL scripts with sample data.

### 4. Automation Scripts:
- Bash script for database backup.
- Bash script for monitoring disk space and sending alerts.
- Schedule a script to check for anomalies and send notifications.

### 5. Java Application Development:
- Develop Java classes for Student, Course, and Department using OOP principles.
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in the Java application.
- Integrate the Java application with the SQL database.
- Test the application with various scenarios.

### 6. Integration and Reporting:
- Implement a feature in the Java application to generate a report.
- The report should display a list of courses, enrolled students, and average GPA for each course.
- Ensure seamless integration between the Java application and the database.
- Make the presentation for the project.

## Usage
1. **Database Setup**: Execute SQL scripts to create and populate the database.
2. **PLSQL Scripts**: Run PLSQL scripts to perform data operations and calculations.
3. **Automation Scripts**: Utilize Bash scripts for database backup, disk space monitoring, and anomaly detection.
4. **Java Application**: Execute Java application to perform CRUD operations and generate reports.
